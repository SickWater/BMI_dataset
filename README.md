# BMI_dataset
A Python project analyzing BMI data using Logistic Regression. Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation with visualizations.

# BMI Analysis using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project uses Python and Scikit-Learn to analyze a BMI dataset and classify individuals into categories based on health metrics. The project covers:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables
- Training a Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation using accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Gender`: Categorical variable indicating male or female
- `Height`: Height of the individual
- `Weight`: Weight of the individual
- `Index`: Target variable representing BMI category (0 or 1)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
